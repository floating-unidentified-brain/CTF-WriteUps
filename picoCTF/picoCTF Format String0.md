# Write up
I ran the program, so far it seems like its asking for a burger, when the burger is not good enough, it says Patrick is still hungry, throws an error when not in the menu, and Patrick becomes satisfied when the burger is good.

The program determines whether the burger is good enough by comparing the size of the string to 2 * BUFSIZE, which may mean Buffer size. It sees whether the string is bigger than 64.

There is a File pointer named f, that gets flag in the flag.txt. flag.txt is a crucial part of the system and needs it to run. Due to an if else and multiple methods using it. Some methods are imported from other classes. Like the fgets, singal, setresgid.

gid_t gid is a missing class.

There are format specifiers in the answers for the burgers, it might be used to solve problem.

I noticed that the flag is an array of Char, basially a string, maybe on the second ask of the system I can call the flag?

The choices IS the menu!

The printf in the serve_bob function can be exploited to get the flag because it looks like a not properly formatted printf, but I need to by pass the menu.

I have figured out I can printf a pointer to point it to the menu item, but can I do something else after that?
\
accidentally solved and got  the flag by using  the  3rd menu item in from  the  second time the computer asked me.

    printf("\n%s\n", flag);
    fflush(stdout);
    exit(1);
}

int on_menu(char *burger, char *menu[], int count) {
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        if (strcmp(burger, menu[i]) == 0)
            return 1;
    }
    return 0;
